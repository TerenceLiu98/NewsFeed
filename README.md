A minimal news webapp based on the [`Cyclododecene/newsfeed`](https://github.com/Cyclododecene/newsfeed) - *not open-source yet*

1. `127.0.0.1:5000/article` is for users to take a glance on the latest news (randomly 5 news) in the
    world by just showing you the title with a summarization generated by algorithm.
2. `127.0.0.1:5000/event` records individual news articles, extracting detailed information on every person, location, number and theme mentioned in an article.
